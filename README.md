# Simple Python Calculator

This is my first Python project â€” a simple calculator built as part of my learning journey.

It performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program runs in a loop, allowing continuous calculations until the user decides to exit.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Continuous calculation loop
- Exit option to stop the program
- Division-by-zero check to prevent errors

## How to Use
1. Run the program (`calculator.py`) using Python 3.
2. Enter the first number.
3. Enter the second number.
4. Choose an operator from `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
5. The result will be displayed.
6. Repeat or type `exit` to quit.

## Future Improvements
- Add a history of previous calculations
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter
- Save results to a file for later use
